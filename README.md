## 📖 About The Project

**Note: This project is currently under active development.**

This repository documents my journey into low-level game development. The goal is to build a 3D game environment from scratch using **C** and the **Raylib** library.

Instead of using a full-fledged engine like Unity or Unreal, I chose this path to gain a deeper understanding of:
* Memory management in C.
* 3D mathematics and rendering pipelines.
* Game loop architecture and core mechanics.

It's challenging, but it's the best way to learn how things really work under the hood.
